Gotta do it gently, though, like easing the clutch in on a cold morning. Choose my words carefully, keep it respectful, and hope for the best.

But between dog walks and wrenching on engines, I don't have a ton of time to be glued to the market. Plus, those Mustangs are a pretty significant investment already!\n\n**My initial thought is to put a good chunk of it in the high-interest savings account for a safe and steady return. But maybe, *maybe*, I'll earmark a smaller, manageable portion for some carefully chosen, long-term stocks \u2013 kinda like adding a little nitrous to the engine for a controlled boost.** Gotta do my research first, though.
